# f*ck you keyboard
Hi, my full name is Jonáš Bartok and I enjoy making printed circuit boards for keyboards lately. 
This is my first project here on GitHub and it is heavily inspired by [this](https://oshwlab.com/ClosedGL2/fuck-you-mechanical-keyboard) open-source project that someone made. 
At first glance, the keyboard seems fully usable, but that's not the case. Today, I went on a mission to change that once and for all. 
Here are some pictures of the progress that I already made: (the USB-C port is not finished yet)
